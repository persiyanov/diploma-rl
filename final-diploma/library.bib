In this study we strive to develop a series of new latent semantic models with a deep structure that project queries and documents into a common low-dimensional space where the relevance of a document given a query is readily computed as the distance between them. The proposed deep structured semantic models are discriminatively trained by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the clicked documents given a query using the clickthrough data. To make our models applicable to large-scale Web search applications, we also use a technique called word hashing, which is shown to effectively scale up our semantic models to handle large vocabularies which are common in such tasks. The new models are evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a real-world data set. Results show that our best model significantly outperforms other latent semantic models, which were considered state-of-the-art in the performance prior to the work presented in this paper.},

	We develop a semantic parsing framework based on semantic similarity for open domain question answering (QA). We focus on single-relation questions and decompose each question into an entity mention and a relation pattern. Using convolutional neural network models, we measure the similarity of entity mentions with entities in the knowledge base (KB) and the similarity of relation patterns and relations in the KB. We score relational triples in the KB using these measures and select the top scoring relational triple to answer the question. When evaluated on an open-domain QA task, our method achieves higher precision across different recall points compared to the previous approach, and can improve F1 by 7 points.

In order to capture the rich contextual structures in a query or a document, we start with each word within a temporal context window in a word sequence to directly capture contextual features at the word n-gram level. Next, the salient word n-gram features in the word sequence are discovered by the model and are then aggregated to form a sentence-level feature vector. Finally, a non-linear transformation is applied to extract high-level semantic information to generate a continuous vector representation for the full text string.

	This paper tackles the sparsity problem in estimating phrase translation probabilities by learning continuous phrase representations, whose distributed nature enables the sharing of related phrases in their representations. A pair of source and target phrases are projected into continuous-valued vector representations in a low-dimensional latent space, where their translation score is computed by the distance between the pair in this new space. The projection is performed by a neural network whose weights are learned on parallel training data. Experimental evaluation has been performed on two WMT translation tasks. Our best result improves the performance of a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system trained on WMT 2012 French-English data by up to 1.3 BLEU points.
